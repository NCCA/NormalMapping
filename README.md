#Normal Mapping
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/NormalMapping.png)

This demo uses the ngl::Obj and ngl::VertexArrayObject classes to read in a mesh then construct an extended VAO passing in Tangents and Bi-Tangents (BiNormals) to glsl as attributes. This is then used to do normal mapping along the lines of [this](http://www.ozone3d.net/tutorials/bump_mapping.php)



Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
